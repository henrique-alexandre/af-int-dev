The goal here is to show you a piece of code that is used at af (albeit in a mildly broken state), 
and give interviewers and interviewee a common codebase to use as a jumping off point for further discussion.
Review the following terraform module, with an eye to being able to discuss how it works, 
fixes or improvements you would bring to it. 
The examples subfolder shows two ways this module can be used.
This can be run in an AWS account you have access to.  
While being able to run terraform plan against the the examples allows for more interactive exploring 
during the interview, but is not required.
